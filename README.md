# Dotfiles!

## Quick start
Running bootstrap.sh should link most of the files. Currently it does:
    - .vimrc
    - .zshrc
    - i3 config
    - nvim config

## Usage
Need to link the file to the correct place on the disk i.e. `ln -s ~/dotfiles/.vimrc ~/`.
Ideal to fork and keep your own version of the git or branch off. Pull requests welcome...there's a long way to go for this.

## Tips
Never link whole folders. Instead link the files inside the folders.

## TODO
Add more links to the bootstrap.sh script
