# Dotfiles!

## Usage
Need to link the file to the correct place on the disk i.e. `ln -s ~/dotfiles/.vimrc ~/`.
Ideal to fork and keep your own version of the git or branch off. Pull requests welcome...there's a long way to go for this.

## Tips
Never link whole folders. Instead link the files inside the folders.

## TODO
Quick start shell script for linux distros
